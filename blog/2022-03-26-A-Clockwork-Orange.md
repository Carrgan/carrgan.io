He was a menace.

We put him away for his own protection.

And also for yours.

We put him away where he can’t do you harm.

You see, we are looking after your interests.

We are interested in you.

When you leave, you’ll have no worries. We’ll see to everything.A good job on a good salary.

We always help our friends, don’t we?
